# Boggle Solver challenge

[Boggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) is a word game played with
alphabetic letter tiles arranged randomly on a grid. Players must identify
words spelled by sequential adjacent letters in any direction
(horizontally, vertically or diagonally), but may not use the same
letter tile twice.

## Challenge

Write a program that solves a 4x4 randomly arranged Boggle grid. 

## Going Further

* What external resources would help?
* What factors impact performance? What would you do to improve them?
* What are the key data structures in use here? What makes them more
  appropriate than alternatives?
* Can your solution handle words that occur within other words? i.e.
  'catcher' -> ['cat', 'catch', 'her']
